    "What is Regularization? Is a way of introducing penalties to (linear) models that are too simple or too complex while adjusting the coefficients to make them generalize better to new data. Another way to think about regularization is as penalties applied to regressions whose coefficients have become too large, and thus, sensitive to all kinds of inputs. These penalties, most notably L1 and L2, minimize the size of the coefficients and/or remove them completely. Here are two of the most important regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ridge - Also called L2 penalty, is a regularization method (and an extension of linear regression) that forces the model parameters to stay as small as possible but without reaching zero. The parameter we optimize is called lambda ($\\lambda$) and it is usually initialized with the value 1.\n",
    "2. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) - Lasso is another type of linear regression model where the coefficients of the variables that don't contribute much to a model, and whose coefficients are too large, will be effectively reduced to zero and removed/ignored by the model. The parameter we optimize is called lambda ($\\lambda$) and it is usually initialized with the value 1. In Python's scikit-learn package the parameter we optimise for is called `alpha`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Important Terms:\n",
    "- Overfitting: happens when your model fits the data too well or, more specifically, when it memorizes the training data and thus, fails to generalize well to new data. Another term used to refer to overfitting is high-variance. This is also a symptom of having too complex a model, e.g. a model with too many variables and not that many observations.\n",
    "- Underfitting: happens when your model is too simple and fails to capture the relationship between the target variable and the features.\n",
    "- bias-variance trade-off: having a good balance between the two above."
